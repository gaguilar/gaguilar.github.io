Welcome to my website!

I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Houston. I focus on Natural Language 
Processing and Machine Learning problems, but I'm also interested in the combination of those with Computer Vision. 
I am currently working on Named Entity Recognition on noisy user-generated text using Deep Learning techniques. 
I work at [Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language (RiTUAL)](http://ritual.uh.edu/) lab, 
and my advisor is [Dr. Thamar Solorio](http://solorio.uh.edu/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at [Beyond Games Inc.](https://www.beyondgames.co/) as a Game Developer for 2 
years and 9 months. I contributed to an MMO mobile game for iOS in many technical aspects (Gameplay, game logic 
on the server side, UI, etc.). I also contributed as a co-leader of the gameplay engineering team. The project 
is massive, and it is still in progress.

Besides my CS career, I used to be a professional chess player. I became the [National Chess Champion of El 
Salvador in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Chess_Championship). Now, I just follow up with the 
latest news on chess.

Hope you enjoy the content on my website, and do not hesitate to get in touch if you have questions or suggestions.
