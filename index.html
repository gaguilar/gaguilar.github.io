		I am Gustavo Aguilar, and I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Houston (December 2020). 
		My dissertation was on <a href="#">Neural Sequence Labeling on Social Media Text</a> and I was advised by
		<a href="http://solorio.uh.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Thamar Solorio</a>.
	</p>
	<p>	
		During my PhD, I had the chance to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching">linguistic code-switching</a> sequence labeling, <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1095/">multimodal and multi-view 
		learning for emotion recognition</a> (Alexa Speech), <a href="https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6229">knowledge distillation</a> (Alexa AI), 
		and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12730">model robustness to social media noise</a> (Salesforce Research). 
	</p>
	<p>
		My PhD was supported by the National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1910192&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF grant #1910192</a>)
		and the <a href="https://snapresearchfs.splashthat.com/">2019 Snap Research Fellowship</a>.
	</p>
	<!-- <p>
		My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
		I am particularly interested in addressing the task of named entity recognition in noisy data.
		Another thread in my research is the computational analysis of linguistic code-switching</a>.
		Additionally, I study multimodal approaches that combine lexical (i.e., phonology, morphology, syntax, and
		semantics) and visual information framed around named-entity-related tasks.

		I work at <a href="http://ritual.uh.edu/" target="_blank">Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language (RiTUAL)</a> lab,
		and my advisor is .

	<h3>Prior to entering the PhD program</h3>

	<p>
		Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at <a href="https://www.beyondgames.co/">Beyond Games Inc.</a> as a Game Developer for 2
		years and 9 months. I contributed to an MMO mobile game for iOS in many technical aspects (Gameplay, game logic
		on the server side, UI, etc.). I also worked as a co-leader of the gameplay engineering team in my last year. Check out the game <a href="https://www.battlestrikeforce.com/">here</a>!
	</p>

	<h3>Chess Life</h3>

	<p>
		I was a professional chess player for more than 10 years. I became the <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/tournament_report.phtml?event16=73889">National Chess Champion of El
		Salvador in 2012</a>. Now, I sporadically play chess at The Chess Refinery club in Houston. I also follow the news for the top players and you may see one or two posts on my blog about it :).
