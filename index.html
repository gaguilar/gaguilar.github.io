	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<br>
	<p>
		<img src="{{ '/assets/images/profile_photo.png' | relative_url }}" width="240" height="240" style="float:right; margin: 0px 30px 30px 20px;" />
		I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Houston.
		My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
		I am particularly interested in addressing the task of named entity recognition in noisy data.
		Another thread in my research is the computational analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching">linguistic code-switching</a>.
		Additionally, I study multimodal approaches that combine lexical (i.e., phonology, morphology, syntax, and
		semantics) and visual information framed around named-entity-related tasks.

	<p>
		I work at <a href="http://ritual.uh.edu/" target="_blank">Research in Text Understanding and Analysis of Language (RiTUAL)</a> lab,
		and my advisor is <a href="http://solorio.uh.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Thamar Solorio</a>.

	<h3>Prior to entering the PhD program</h3>

	<p>
		Before starting my Ph.D., I worked at <a href="https://www.beyondgames.co/">Beyond Games Inc.</a> as a Game Developer for 2
		years and 9 months. I contributed to an MMO mobile game for iOS in many technical aspects (Gameplay, game logic
		on the server side, UI, etc.). I also worked as a co-leader of the gameplay engineering team in my last year. Check out the game <a href="https://www.battlestrikeforce.com/">here</a>!

	<h3>Chess Life</h3>

	<p>
		I was a professional chess player for more than 10 years. I became the <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/tournament_report.phtml?event16=73889">National Chess Champion of El
		Salvador in 2012</a>. Now, I sporadically play chess at The Chess Refinery club in Houston. I also follow the news for the top players and you may see one or two posts on my blog about it :).
